Hi all,

This is my first try at making an Android app. This simply adds a custom sound when folding or unfolding your phones. Assuming you have a Flip or a Fold.

For notifications part, you can edit the notification setting on your phone so the Flip Audio notification doesn't show all the time.

Tested and working with:
- Samsung Flip 6
- Samsung Flip 7
- Samsung Fold 6
- Samsung Fold 7
